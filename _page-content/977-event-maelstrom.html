			<p class="font-secondary">Maelstrom Mixer is Faultline 40K’s first ever open event.  You don’t need to be a member of our club to participate, though we’re hoping that after showing up and sharing in our interpretation of this amazing hobby, you might consider joining us if you’re local. </p>
			<p class="font-secondary dice">Somewhat unique in the 40K World, we are excited to host an event that is comprised entirely of narrative gaming.  Competitive play is great, but at Faultline 40K, we focus on narrative play and social connectivity and that is what we are looking to make this event about.</p>
			<p class="font-secondary skull">For this event, our partner is Game Kastle, the Bay Area’s premier store for games and gamers.  Maelstrom Mixer will take place at Game Kastle Mountain View, Game Kastle’s flagship store is an amazing and spacious venue for our event and as a club, it’s our home.</p>
			<p class="font-secondary cherry">We hope you’ll join us for two straight days of narrative 40K, Kill Team, and of course, bar hopping in Silicon Valley!</p>

				<p class="font-white">Armies brought to the event need to be fully painted and based.  Fully painted means at least 3 colors.  This is deeply rooted in our group’s culture and we’re not flexible on it.  The 40K universe is dark and grim, but it’s also beautiful and we strive to make our games reflect this.</p>

				<p class="font-white">Lists need to be built with your opponent’s enjoyment in mind and not solely your own.  Netlists and WAAC are not part of the Faultline culture and will not be part of our event.  Bring a few great units and some fun ones that you’ve always wanted to play.  List guidelines will be provided and individual event organizers may request that lists be submitted in advance.</p>
