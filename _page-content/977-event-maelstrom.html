							<p>The system of Spiti is an old system that dates back to before the Fall. The region’s intellectually advanced race mix is a bit one dimensional. Eldari of every sort and sub-faction can be found in or hovering at the fringes of the system. For this reason tensions typically focus on interspecies issues. That was the norm until the Orks arrived.</p>
							<p>Expect a classic ork waaaaagh defense ruleset with specific missions crafted to bring to life the feeling of a system wide Ork invasion and the associated affects. Namely, unlikely allies.</p>
