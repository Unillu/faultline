# Faultline 40K Website

An open source web project for the members of the group Faultline 40K in Silicon Valley.

## Getting Started

You'll need to install a local instance of Wordpress for testing purposes. You can get the latest Wordpress version [here](https://wordpress.org/download/).

This repository should be cloned into the wp-content/themes directory. In the Wordpress backend you can select Faultline as the active theme.

## Prerequisites

* Install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org).
* Install [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/install).
* Install Wordpress locally with [Mamp](https://codex.wordpress.org/Installing_WordPress_Locally_on_Your_Mac_With_MAMP).

To request the Faultline database for your local setup, send me a message.
